# Corebiz e-commerce Home

This is a web page of e-commerce made with Pug.js and SCSS.
I started this project to trainning my skills on a new stack used by my squad on Corebiz.
The most hard feature is the pug compiler. He work like a webpack to compile the project to the html and css archives on public folder.
